= dsimage

NOTE: Its use case is very narrow and was created as an **4h hackaton experiment to learn Rust language**.

Simple application for optimizing images for Web written in Rust.

Program works in CLI environment, taking image filename as first and only argument, i.e.:

[source,shell]
----
dsimage my_image.jpg
----

Results are saved in `optimized` directory, where each file is greatly reduced in size,
three thumbnails are generated as well as grayscale representation of an image.

== Installation

== Building from sources

You need Rust installed locally. To build release executable run:

----
