= dsimage

Simple application for optimizing images for Web.

NOTE: Its use case is very narrow and was created as an **experiment**.

Image optimization has been written in Rust.

Program works in CLI environment, taking image filename as first and only argument, i.e.:

[source,shell]
====
dsimage my_image.jpg
====

Results are saved in `optimized` directory, where each file is greatly reduced in size,
three thumbnails are generated as well as grayscale representation of an image.

== Installation

Windows 64bit *.exe and Linux x64_86 binaries are included.

== Building from sources

You need Rust installed locally. To build release executable run:

[source,shell]
====
cargo build --release
====
